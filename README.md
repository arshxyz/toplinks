# toplinks

## Use
1. Search for anything on Google and Youtube
2. Press 1, 2 or 3 to open the corresponding link
3. Hold Shift while pressing the key to open in a new tab


## Installation (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera)

1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/)
2. Click [here](https://github.com/arshxyz/toplinks/raw/main/toplinks.user.js), a Tampermonkey tab should open
3. Click install, and you're done

## Why
1. I prefer using keyboard shortcuts for simple things
2. With the new GenAI updates, the first link is often pushed further down below. I can press 1 to open the first link without having to scroll down.
